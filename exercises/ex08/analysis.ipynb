In the markdown cell below, brainstorm 3 to 5 ideas you think would create value for you.\n",

    "1. The course should implement more small, low-stake, coding assignments (such as mini exercises) to further build on concepts learned about in class, but with shorter time commitments. This allows for students to practice the concepts covered more thoroughly. As set up, I feel as sometimes the jump from content covered in class to a full exercise is a large one, and this would help close the gap. Students enrolled and prospective students would ideally benefit from this change.\n",
    "2. The course should implement a preclass question form for students to fill out regarding conceptual questions which is then reviewed in the upcoming class. This can both help students who are confused, as well as the professor(s) to gauge student understanding. These questions could be talked about in the first few minutes of class. \n",
    "3. The course should implement quiz corrections for students to complete for 25% credit redemption. These corrections must be thorough and explained and credit will only be granted if both criteria are met. Students could potentially do this for all quizzes or could select two (would need a few trial runs to understand how this affects overall grades and if the 25% redemption needed to be adjusted.) Enrolled and prospective students would benefit from this change, as some people are poor test takers, and all students would benefit from the ability to correct their quiz mistakes, but incentivized by the credit redemption.\n",

One aspect of _continuous improvement_ is trying to avoid \"tunnel vision\" where possible improvements are not considered because there is no data available to analyze it.

We will not know how this will affect the course perception and student performance until it's implemented. Further, we can very roughly gauge how this would improve COMP 110 based off both `ls_effective` and `lsqs_effective` categories, but because this form is a completely new idea, we would likely only be presented with a rough correlation. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Suggestion for how to collect data to support this idea in the future: A potential way to collect this data is to implement the form, and collect things such as `form_used` which counts how many times the form was used, and `form_perception` which collects student perception of the form (i.e. did they find it helpful?). Both of these would help to support (or not support) the effectiveness and benefit of this idea. We may also find that this form is not helpful, and thus can be disregarded in favor of alternate improvements. "
